# Prototypes

JavaScript prototype is the viewpoint where Object Oriented Programming would attempt to enter the JavaScript world.

We need to remember that one way objects are created is via the `new` keyword i.e. Constructor Call, once we  use the `new` keyword
we are tempted to think that we are copying the function call to create our new object, but in fact we are instead *linking*.

Think about having an Employee with `name` and `lastname` property:

```JavaScript
function Employee(name, lastname) {
  this.name = name;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

Employee.prototype.getName = function() {
  console.log(this.name + ' ' + this.lastname);
}
```

And we create `John Stamos` our `new` employee:

```JavaScript
var johnStamos = new Employee('John', 'Stamos');
```

At this very point we have `linked` `johnStamos` to `Employee`, I can now inspect `johnStamos`:

```JavaScript
console.log(johnStamos.constructor);
/* Prints:
ƒ Employee(name, lastname) {
  this.name = name;
  this.lastname = lastname;
} */

Object.getPrototypeOf(johnStamos)
/* Prints:
{getName: ƒ, constructor: ƒ}
- getName :ƒ ()
- constructor: ƒ Employee(name, lastname)
- __proto__ : Object
```

I can see there that the constructor function points to `Employee` and the prototype points to an object that has `getName` and `constructor` with a *linkage* to `Object`. 

If you console.log `Object.getPrototypeOf(johnStamos) === Employee.prototype` we will assert that johnStamos points to the Emplorre prototype.

## Prototype Chain

Prototype chain is the mechanism that takes advantage of the prototype link to find methods as in lexical scope. When we call `johnStamos.getName()` we can assure that `getName` does not exists in the `johnStamos` object and will lookup on its protoype chain reaching `Employee` prototype `getName`.

## Prototype example

```JavaScript
function Employee(name) {
  this.name = name;
  return this
} 

Employee.prototype.getName = function() {
  return 'My name is ' + this.name
}

var emp1 = new Employee('John');
var emp2 = new Employee('Amy');

emp2.works = function() {
  console.log(this.getName() + ' and I work');
}
```
